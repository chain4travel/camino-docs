| [**Issuing API Calls**](issuing-api-calls)      | This guide explains how to make calls to APIs exposed by Camino nodes.                                                                           |
| [**The Platform Chain (P-Chain) API**](p-chain) | Allows clients to interact with the P-Chain (Platform Chain), which maintains Camino’s validator set and handles blockchain and Subnet creation. |
| [**The Contract Chain (C-Chain) API**](c-chain) | Allows clients to interact with the C-Chain, Camino’s main EVM instance, as well as other EVM instances.                                         |
| [**The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) API**](x-chain) | Allows clients to create and trade assets, including CAM, on the X-Chain as well as other instances of the AVM.                                  |
| [**The Admin API**](admin)                      | Allows clients to examine a node’s internal state, set of connections, and similar internal protocol data.                                       |
| [**The Auth API**](auth)                        | Allows clients to manage the creation and revocation of authorization tokens.                                                                    |
| [**The Health API**](health)                    | Allows clients to check a node’s health.                                                                                                         |
| [**The Index API**](index-api)                  | Fetch transactions, vertex, or block by ID.                                                                                                      |
| [**The Info API**](info)                        | Allows clients to examine basic information about a node.                                                                                        |
| [**The IPC API**](ipc)                          | Allows users to create Unix domain sockets for blockchains to publish to.                                                                        |
| [**The Keystore API**](keystore)                | Allows customers to use the embedded Keystore file of an Avalanche node.                                                                         |
| [**The Metrics API**](metrics)                  | Allows clients to get statistics about a node’s health and performance.                                                                          |
