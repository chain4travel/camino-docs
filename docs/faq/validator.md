# Validator FAQ

## Who can be an Camino validator?

Any travel industry market participant who fulfills the following conditions can be a validator on the Camino Mainnet:

- Have at least 100,000 Camino (CAM) tokens locked in their wallet
- Is KYC / KYB verified
- Has been admitted as a validator by the validator consortia via a vote
  The last condition is omitted for Validators who secure the network from the start. To secure the Columbus Testnet, one must only be a market participant in the travel industry.

## Staking Parameters on Camino

When a validator is done validating the Camino Mainnet, it receives back the Camino tokens it staked. It may receive a reward for helping to secure the network. A validator only receives a validation reward if it is sufficiently responsive and correct during the validation period.

- The exact amount that a validator must stake is 100,000 CAM
- The time period one can stake funds for validation is 1 year

## Can I add more Camino (CAM) tokens to my validator while the staking period is in progress?

No. The exact amount that must be staked to run a validator is 100,000 CAM.
You can, however, lock additional CAM in your wallet that is used to configure your validator node. Your validator rewards will not increase by doing so. Instead, the additional Camino tokens will be subject to the respective reward percentage for locked tokens.

## Can I use my locked Camino (CAM) tokens to run a validator node?

Yes, you will be able to stake locked Camino (CAM) tokens in order to create a validator node.

## Can I run more than one validator node?

No. On Camino, validators secure the network and democratically govern the Camino ecosystem. Therefore, it is not possible to run more than one validator as this would jeopardize the democratic voting process.

## Do I need to keep my private keys on my validator?

No, you don’t need to keep your private keys on your validator (and we strongly advise you not to).

## Is my validating node uptime important?

Yes. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 90% of their validation period. You should aim for your validator to be online and responsive 100% of the time.

## Can I stop my validator and stop staking at any time?

No, your stake is locked for the pre-defined staking period. Your stake is automatically returned to your address upon completion.
