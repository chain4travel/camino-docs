# Validator FAQ

### Who can be a Camino validator?

Any participant in the travel industry who meets the following criteria can become a validator on the Camino Mainnet:

- Holds a minimum of 100,000 Camino (CAM) tokens in their wallet.
- Has undergone and passed a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Know-Your-Business (KYB) verification process.
- Has been elected as a validator by the validator consortium through a voting process.

:::note

Please note, the last requirement is not applicable for validators who are securing the network from its inception. For securing the Columbus Testnet, it's sufficient to be a market participant in the travel industry.

### What are staking parameters for validators on Camino Network?

- The exact amount that a validator must stake is **100,000 CAM**.
- The time period one can stake funds for a validator is between **2 weeks** (min) and **1 year** (max).

:::note

When a validator completes its role in validating the Camino Mainnet, they will receive their staked Camino tokens back. Additionally, they may also receive a reward for their contribution in securing the network. However, it's worth noting that a validator will only receive a validation reward if it has been sufficiently responsive and accurate during the validation period.

### Can I add more Camino (CAM) tokens to my validator while the staking period is in progress?

No. The exact amount that must be staked to run a validator is 100,000 CAM.
You can, however, lock (deposit) additional CAM in your wallet that is used to configure your validator node. Your validator rewards will not increase by doing so. Instead, the additional Camino tokens will be subject to the respective reward percentage for locked tokens.

### Can I use my locked (deposited) Camino (CAM) tokens to run a validator node?

Yes, you will be able to stake locked (deposited) Camino (CAM) tokens in order to create a validator node.

### Can I run more than one validator node?

No. On Camino, validators secure the network and democratically govern the Camino ecosystem. Therefore, it is not possible to run more than one validator as this would jeopardize the democratic voting process.

### Do I need to keep my private keys on my validator?

No, you donâ€™t need to keep your private keys on your validator (and we strongly advise you not to).

### Is my validating node uptime important?

Yes. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 90% of their validation period. You should aim for your validator to be online and responsive 100% of the time.

### Can I stop my validator and stop staking at any time?

No, your stake is locked for the pre-defined staking period. Your stake is automatically returned to your address upon completion.
