# What is the Camino Name Service?

The Camino Name Service (CNS) is a decentralized naming system built for the Camino Network.
It functions similarly to the Domain Name System (DNS) of Web 2, but instead of translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, CNS maps readable names like "travel.cam" to machine-readable identifiers, such as Camino X-,P- and C-Chain addresses, content hashes, and other metadata.
The Camino Name Service is inspired by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) but is adjusted to the needs of the Camino Netowrk.

## Domains
The Camino Network enables users to register the Top Level Domain (TLD) <i>.cam</i> in the Camino Suite. 

The [CNS Manager App](./app.md) enables user to purchase domains, such as "travel.cam". Domains have to be registered for a minimum of 1 year. They are paid for by approved ERC-20 tokens with varying base prices. 

## Subdomais
CNS builds a hierarchical subdomain space which,
for example can be used to create and control subdomains like "booking.travel.cam" or "blog.travel.cam". This offers significant flexibility and allows domain owners to manage different use cases and delegate control in the Camino Netowrk.

Possible use cases range from decentralized websites, identity systems, to complex organizational structures. 
Each level of the hierarchy inherits the security and properties of the CNS, while also allowing for customization.
