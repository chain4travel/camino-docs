that during this stage, breaking changes may occur without advance notice.
Users should proceed with caution.

## Introduction

This document guides you through the installation of the Camino Messenger Bot
using two distinct methods. The first method involves [compiling the
software](#compiling-from-source) from its source code, while the second
method [utilizes Docker](#building-docker-image) to create an image and run a
container.

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

**Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:**

```sh
sudo apt install libolm-dev
sudo snap install go --classic
```

### Get the Source

To get started, clone the Camino Messenger Bot repository and initialize the
submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-messenger-bot.git
cd camino-messenger-bot
git submodule update --init
```

### Install Go Dependencies

Install the required Go dependencies with:

```sh
go mod download
```

### Build

Compile the application using the following command:

```sh
go build -o bot cmd/camino-messenger-bot/main.go
```

### Verify

To ensure the build was successful, check for the `bot` binary:

```
./bot -help
```

Running bot -help should produce the following output:

```
$ ./bot -help
Usage of ./bot:
  -config string
    	Path to configuration file
```

Below is a screen capture of all the steps above done on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS:

## Building Docker Image

Follow these steps to build the Docker image.

### Get the Source

First, clone the Camino Messenger Bot repository and initialize the
submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-messenger-bot.git
cd camino-messenger-bot
git submodule update --init
```

### Build the Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build --tag camino-messenger-bot .
```

After a successful build, test the image with:

```sh
docker run --rm camino-messenger-bot -help
```

The expected output should be:

```
Usage of ./camino-messenger-bot:
  -config string
    	Path to configuration file
```
