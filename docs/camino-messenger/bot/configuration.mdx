:::info SUPPORTED REQUEST TYPES

The configuration for supported request types is particularly relevant for
provider bots offering specific services, such as accommodation search or
transport search. However, it is recommended that all bots enable `PingRequest`
messages, with the exception of `PingRequest` being the universal function
every bot should support.

:::

## Creating a Wallet for the Bot

Navigate to [Camino Wallet](https://suite.camino.network/wallet/home)
and create a wallet for use with your bot deployment. Once you have logged
into your wallet, proceed to the "Manage Keys" tab. Here, click on "View
Private Key" next to your key listed under the "My Keys" section.

![](/img/messenger/get-private-key.png)

Enter this private key into the configuration file for your bot.

## Configuring for Development

To set up your environment for development, default example config files
should be enough. Note that the default files have omitted
certificate-related fields to allow for unencrypted communication.

:::info PARTNER PLUGIN HOST & PORT

Please ensure that the **partner plugin host & port** align with the active
partner plugin settings. For further details, refer to the
[partner plugin page](partner-plugin#running-the-partner-plugin).

:::

:::caution TRANSACTION FEES

Ensure that your wallet, associated with the `evm_private_key`, contains CAM
tokens to cover transaction fees. Your C-Chain address will be displayed when
you run the bot.

:::

## Run

Run the bot with the command below, change the config file name file accordingly.

```sh
./bot -config camino-messenger-bot.yaml
```

## Configuring the Docker Container

For those utilizing Docker for bot installation, configure your environment
variables as shown below.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file bot.env camino-messenger-bot
```

Your `bot.env` file should contain the following settings:

```sh
CMB_DEVELOPER_MODE=true
CMB_MATRIX_KEY=PrivateKey-qzCMkC3mbCD94pUTeQgufWLv9BPKc4qiDW9GzHWTcEDCRiSjU
CMB_MATRIX_HOST=matrix.camino.network
CMB_MATRIX_STORE=mautrix-localhost.db
CMB_RPC_SERVER_PORT=9090
CMB_RPC_UNENCRYPTED=true
CMB_PARTNER_PLUGIN_HOST=distributor-plugin
CMB_PARTNER_PLUGIN_PORT=50051
CMB_PARTNER_PLUGIN_UNENCRYPTED=true
CMB_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=3000
CMB_SUPPORTED_REQUEST_TYPES=ActivitySearchRequest,AccommodationSearchRequest,GetNetworkFeeRequest,GetPartnerConfigurationRequest,PingRequest,TransportSearchRequest
CMB_RPC_URL=https://columbus.camino.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
CMB_BOOKING_TOKEN_ABI_FILE=abi/BookingTokenV0.abi
CMB_BOOKING_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xd4e2D76E656b5060F6f43317E8d89ea81eb5fF8D
CMB_SUPPLIER_NAME=SUPPLIER_NAME
CMB_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=PrivateKey-THE_REST_OF_THE_KEY
```

:::tip CHECK DOCKER COMPOSE FILE

For more detailed configuration, refer to the `docker-compose.yaml` file provided in the repository.
