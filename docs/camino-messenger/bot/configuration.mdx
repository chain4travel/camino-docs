:::info SUPPORTED REQUEST TYPES

The supported request types and the applicable service fee are taken from
the CM account. The bot will not start-up when a message type is specified
in the CM Account but not supported by the current version of the bot.
Please make sure that the CM-Account and the running version of the bot
are aligned with the supported versions of the services. The bot does
always support the latest 3 versions of each service.

:::

## Creating a Wallet for the Bot

Navigate to [Camino Wallet](https://suite.camino.network/wallet/home)
and create a wallet for use with your bot deployment. Once you have logged
into your wallet, proceed to the "Manage Keys" tab. Here, click on "View
Private Key" next to your key listed under the "My Keys" section.

![](/img/messenger/get-private-key.png)

Enter this private key into the configuration file for your bot.

## Configuring for Development

To set up your environment for development, default example config files
should be enough. Note that the default files have omitted
certificate-related fields to allow for unencrypted communication.

:::info PARTNER PLUGIN HOST & PORT

Please ensure that the **partner plugin host & port** align with the active
partner plugin settings. For further details, refer to the
[partner plugin page](partner-plugin#running-the-partner-plugin).

:::

:::caution TRANSACTION FEES

Ensure that your wallet, associated with the `bot_key`, contains CAM
tokens to cover transaction fees. Your C-Chain address will be displayed when
you run the bot.

:::

## Run

Run the bot with the command below, change the config file name file accordingly.

```sh
./bot -config camino-messenger-bot.yaml
```

## Configuring the Docker Container

For those utilizing Docker for bot installation, load the configuration as shown below:

```sh
docker run --config /test_config.yaml camino-messenger-bot
```

:::tip CHECK DOCKER COMPOSE FILE

For more detailed configuration, refer to the `docker-compose.yaml` file provided in the repository.

:::

## Example Output

After launching the bot, you can expect to see an output similar to the following:
