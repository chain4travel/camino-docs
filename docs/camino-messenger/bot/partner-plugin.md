## What is Partner Plugin?

The Partner Plugin serves as a bridge enabling the Camino Messenger Bot to
integrate seamlessly with pre-existing systems. This tool is crafted for both
distributors and providers, coming equipped with a reference implementation
to illustrate potential integration strategies.

Functioning as an intermediary, the Partner Plugin establishes a gRPC server
that mirrors the bot's, effectively acting as a conduit for requests not
directly handled by the bot itself. These requests are then channeled to the
partner plugin which, after the necessary data transformation, forwards them
to the existing system of the distributor or provider. For example, should
the existing system accept search queries via a REST API, the Partner
Plugin's responsibilities would include:

- Receiving requests from the bot via its gRPC server.
- Executing REST calls to communicate with the existing system, thereby
  facilitating the integration process.

Example implementation can be found at `examples/rpc/partner-plugin/server.go` within the
[Camino Messenger Bot repository](https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-messenger-bot).

:::note

Please note that the Partner Plugin is fundamentally a mockup designed solely
for responding to incoming messages with mock data.

This application is compatible with all request types outlined in the Camino
Messenger Protocol. However, **it is not mandatory for a provider plugin** to
incorporate request types that are not applicable to the partner's services.
