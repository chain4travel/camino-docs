# Download Camino Node Database

## Why would you want to download the Database?

When deploying a new node, the camino-node needs to download the blockchain database and bootstrap,
which can be a time-consuming process. However, you can expedite this process by downloading the
pre-existing database from another node that has already been bootstrapped.

To facilitate this, Camino Network offers compressed database files (tarballs) that allow users to
download and bootstrap their nodes more quickly.

## How to download and use the Tarball?

To download and activate your node with the newly downloaded database, follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Database

Download the database from one of the following links. It is recommended to choose the latest version.

** Download Camino (mainnet) latest:**

<pre>
  wget <LatestCaminoDB onlyurl="true" />
</pre>

** Download Columbus (testnet) latest:**

<pre>
  wget <LatestCaminoDB network="columbus" onlyurl="true" />
</pre>

### 2. Stop Camino Node

If your camino-node is currently running, stop it by executing the following command:

```
systemctl stop camino-node
```

If you are running camino-node using a Docker image, please stop the container.

### 3. Replace the Database Directory

Replace the contents of the `.caminogo/db` directory with the contents of the downloaded tarball file.

**Extract the tarball**

```
tar zxvf camino_db_230713.tar.gz
```

:::info DATA DIRECTORY

The data directory for camino-node is specified either from the command line or the config file using the `--data-dir` flag.
By default, the data directory is set to `$HOME/.caminogo`. If you have changed the data directory, please update the commands below accordingly.

:::

**Remove your camino-node db directory**

```
rm -rf .caminogo/db
```

**Move newly extracted `db` directory to it's place**

```
mv db .caminogo/
```

### 4. Start the Camino Node

Restart the camino-node by executing the following command:

```
systemctl start camino-node
```

If you are running camino-node using a Docker image, please start the container.

### 5. Check Status of Your Node

Check if your node is healthy

```
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method" :"health.health"}' \
  -H 'content-type:application/json;' http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health
```

Output should be similar to the one below. Note the `healthy: true` at the end.

```
