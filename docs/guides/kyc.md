# Know-Your-Customer Verification

## Overview

The Camino Network is set to revolutionize travel, and with new and exciting ways to
create and enjoy travel experiences, come the possibility of ill-intentioned people
or organizations taking advantage of them. Therefore, Camino uses a KYC service/process
to protect travellers and businesses from fraud.

## What is KYC and how does it work?

KYC stands for Know Your Client/Customer, and it is a regulatory process used to verify
the identity and other credentials of a user. It is legally mandatory in most countries
to ensure users are who they claim to be and to help against money laundering and
the financing of terrorist activities. Additionally, if users on the Camino network are
verified, it enhances trustworthiness and reduces risk, thereby improving the overall
experience.

To be verified, the user must share an ID document and pass a liveness check to authenticate.
Once the user has successfully completed the verification process, their wallet will be
associated with a verified KYC status. This enables other network participants and builders
to identify wallets that have a verified KYC, without disclosing any personal KYC information
provided by the user.

:::caution NO PRIVATE INFO IS SAVED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN

No personal information will be saved on the Camino blockchain or any other public ledger
when using Camino KYC verification.

## Who conducts verification?

The user's information is verified against documents issued by authorities or against
information obtained from independent and reliable sources to ensure the user has not
provided false documents or incorrect information.

Verification of documents can be manual or automatic. Manual verification takes time,
is prone to errors and might not spot increasingly advanced forged documents. Therefore,
an automatic approach that compares documents against various open data sources and performs
checks for optical security features is used to speed up the process and minimize the risk
of fraudulent activities.

Sumsub, an all-in-one verification platform (https://sumsub.com), will perform the verification
of the user’s documents. The platform will store the copies of the documents presented
by the user in an encrypted format on secure servers that comply with GDPR requirements.
As a result, the platform ensures the users' documents are kept safe and tamper-free. The Camino
blockchain only retains a simple entry if a wallet address is verified or not, but none of the
personal documents or information will be stored on-chain.

## When should a user become KYC verified?

There is no specified point in time for when KYC must be done. Camino Network Foundation will
offer a KYC process to all participants of the Camino blockchain. Instead, it can be done
whenever the user pleases. However, one cannot deploy smart contracts on Camino or join
the Camino Consortium if not verified. There may also be dApps that can only be used by verified users.

## KYC documents

Different ID documents may be used to verify a user, including the ID card, passport, or driver’s license.
The available ID document for the KYC service depends on the user's nationality.

## Advantages

While KYC verification is not mandatory for individuals who want to use smart contracts to buy and sell
on Camino, it is required for those who want to deploy smart contracts and conduct business on the network.

In addition, verifying users in compliance with local regulations provides protection against unforeseen
problems related to verification and compliance regulations, as well as protection from penalties for noncompliance.

Ultimately, a verified status allows the user to participate in a self-sovereign identity system, providing
streamlined and secure access to services while maintaining control over their identity information.
