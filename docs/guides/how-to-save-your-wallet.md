# How to Save Your Wallet

The Camino Wallet provides a feature to safely save your wallet to your browser's
local storage for easy access in the future.

:::caution Ensure That You Have Your Key Phrase

Please keep in mind that this feature uses your browser's local storage to save your
wallet in a secure and encrypted format.

If you lose your password, clear your browser's cache, or if your computer is lost,
stolen, or malfunctions, you may not be able to access your saved wallet.

In any of those cases, **you will need your key phrase to recover your wallet**.

:::

## Open the Save Account Dialog

To save your wallet, first, click on the dropdown menu located in the top right corner of the screen.

## Fill in the Form

Once the "Save Account" dialog box is open, you will need to fill in the required
information to save your wallet.

First, choose a name for your wallet. This name can be anything you choose,
but make sure it is unique and easy for you to remember.

Next, create a strong and secure password for your wallet. Ideally, your password should
be at least 8 characters long and should include a combination of upper and
lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Remember to keep your password secure
and do not share it with anyone.

## Verify Your Saved Wallet

Once you have saved your wallet, you can verify that it has been successfully
saved by checking the top right corner of the Camino Wallet interface.
You should see the name of your saved wallet displayed in place of the "Login" button.

If you see your wallet name, it means that your wallet has been successfully saved
and is now accessible from your browser's local storage. Congratulations!

## Change Password or Delete Saved Wallet

If you need to change the password for your saved wallet or delete it entirely,
you can do so by accessing the Account Settings menu.

To access the Account Settings, click on the name of your saved wallet in the
top right corner of the Camino Wallet interface. This will open a dropdown menu.
From there, click on the "Manage Account" button.

This will open the Account Settings popup window. From here, you can change the
password for your saved wallet or delete it entirely.

To change the password, click on the "Change Password" button and follow the
prompts to create a new, secure password.

To delete the saved wallet, click on the "Delete Account" button and follow the
prompts to confirm the deletion. Please note that once you delete a saved wallet,
it cannot be recovered, so make sure you have backed up your key phrase before
deleting your wallet.
