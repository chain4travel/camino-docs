# Reasons for Validator Suspension

Camino Network has a mechanism to suspend validators to prevent network unavailability
due to bad actors or poorly configured nodes. The following are the reasons why a
validator may be suspended.

## Losing Consortium Membership

To run a validator node on Camino Network, one must be a consortium member.
A validator will be suspended if its owner loses membership.

## Network Availability

Validators must be online and responsive to ensure a healthy network.
To earn staking rewards, validators must have at least 80% uptime.

When a validator's availability is not healthy and has frequent interruptions, the network
is affected. The reasons for this may include:

- Firewall and networking issues
- Low uptime due to power or system failures
- Undersized hardware or slow performance
- Failure to update Camino Node software

If any of the above reasons causes a validator to have subpar availability, it may be suspended.

## Network Integrity

A validator may be suspended if it risks the network's integrity. This may happen if the node
generates different results than the other validators excessively or if a bad actor tries to
manipulate the network.
